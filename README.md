Example paxos system using the Python eventsourcing library

This example follows the original Cargo Shipping example
that figures in the DDD book, as coded in the "DDD Sample"
project. As it says on the project website, "This project is a
joint effort by Eric Evans' company Domain Language and
the Swedish software consulting company Citerus.

"One of the most requested aids to coming up to speed on DDD
has been a running example application. Starting from a simple
set of functions and a model based on the cargo example used
in Eric Evans' book, we have built a running application with
which to demonstrate a practical implementation of the building
block patterns as well as illustrate the impact of aggregates
and bounded contexts."
